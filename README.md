A lightweight React To-Do List app featuring:

- Task add, delete, completion toggle
- Filtering (all, completed, pending)

- Dark mode toggle
- Drag-and-drop task sorting
- Local-only user authentication (signup + login stored in `localStorage`)
- Persistent tasks & auth session using `localStorage`
- Plain CSS styling for clean, modern UI

## Features

- **Signup & Login:** Users can create accounts and login. User credentials are stored locally (demo only — not secure for production).
- **Task Management:** Add tasks with optional subtasks. Mark tasks and subtasks as complete or delete them.
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Filter tasks by status and reorder tasks with drag-and-drop.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Local Persistence:** Tasks and user sessions are saved in `localStorage` to persist between sessions.
